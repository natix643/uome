        Use simple debts if you want only to record who you lend your money to
        or vice versa, who you owe to.
        </p>
        
        <p>Beyond money, you can also manage non-monetary loans, for example lending of a book.</p>

        <p>
        Group debts are suitable for one-time or periodic collective events,
        such as trips, parties or regularly played card games.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        They are based on the principle of deposits and withdrawals (similar to a bank).
        Each person in a group has his/hers own virtual account
        where he/she can deposit to or withdraw money from.
        You therefore become the group\'s banker, however you may also add youself
        into the group, if you actively participate in the event.
        </p>
        
        <p>Individual groups are independent on each other, their members are not shared among them.</p>
        
        <p>
        <b>Example:</b><br/>
        
        Imagine playing football with your friends regularly and paying for a pitch. 
        But you have to always collect money from them at the end.
        With this application, permanent players can subscribe it (deposit money on their account).
        After the event you just select people who attended that day and enter the total amount
        which is then divided equally among all participants
        (each participant withdraws money according to his/her share).
